## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, modern blue (#3F51B5) to represent technical expertise and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Very dark blue (#080A19), almost black. The background color should not exactly match the navy specified by the user to prevent the design from appearing dated.
- Accent color: A lively violet (#BB86FC), which is analogous to blue in the color wheel, adding energy and highlighting interactive elements.
- Headings: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, bold, and clean look.
- Body: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clean, readable, and professional-looking text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, line-based icons for navigation and social media links.
- Subtle hover effects on buttons and project cards for a modern feel.
